# How to build an online route planner with Amazon Location Service

Use this project to learn how to build an online route planner that finds optimal routes between an origin, a destination, and up to 23 stops along the way (waypoints) for different modes of transportation (car, truck, and walking), avoidances (tolls and ferries), and departure times. You will build a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) app using [Amazon Location Service](http://%20https//aws.amazon.com/location/?trk=c5799a1c-5743-48da-8900-0b1392ff83c0&sc_channel=el), as the basemap provider and routing API, [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/), as the map rendering library, and [Naive UI](https://www.naiveui.com/en-US/os-theme), as the UI component library.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification

```
